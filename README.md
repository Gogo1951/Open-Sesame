# Open Sesame!

A simple add-on that automatically opens clams, treat bags, and other containers in your inventory — no clicks required.

⚠️ **Auto Loot must be enabled for Open Sesame to work correctly!**

## Usage

* Left-click the minimap icon to toggle enable/disable. (Open Sesame is on by default when installed.)
* The addon automatically pauses when you have **fewer than 4 free bag slots**, and resumes once you have **5 or more**.
* Containers won’t open during combat or while interaction windows are up (vendors, mail, quests, gossip, etc.), or when the container is known to contain a BoP or Unique item.
* That’s it — everything else is automatic.

🚫 **The "UseContainerItem" API call no longer works on clams. This likely has something to do with the "[Clam Weaving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3YO7jeoOWs)" hack.**

## History

👏 **I didn't create this add-on, I just updated it for TBC and Wrath.**

Looking around CurseForge, it looks like the bulk of the original code came from kAutoOpen.
