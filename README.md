## How it Works

⚠️ **Important**: Auto Loot must be enabled in your game settings for Open Sesame to function correctly.

* **Toggle Control** : Left-click the minimap icon to quickly toggle the addon ON or OFF. (It is enabled by default).
* **Speedy Loot** : This option hides the loot window entirely to achieve significantly faster looting.
* **Smart Pausing** : Automatically protects your inventory space. The addon pauses when you drop below 4 free bag slots and resumes once you have 5 or more.
* **Safety First** : Containers will never open during combat, while interacting with NPCs (vendors, mail, quest givers), or if the container holds BoP/Unique items requiring confirmation.
* **Locked Items** : If you loot a locked item (like a lockbox), Open Sesame attempts to open it automatically the moment you unlock it.
* **Raid Safe** : To prevent Master Looter accidents or clutter during raids, gem bags dropped by bosses are excluded from auto-opening.

## History

👏 **I didn't create this add-on, I just updated it for TBC and Wrath.**

Looking around CurseForge, it looks like the bulk of the original code came from kAutoOpen.
