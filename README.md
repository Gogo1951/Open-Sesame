# Open Sesame!

A simple add-on that automatically opens clams & containers in your inventory.

❗ **Auto Loot must be enabled for Open Sesame! to work correctly!**

⚙️ Open Sesame! under the following conditions:

- You are not in combat (anything looted during combat will be opened as soon as combat is over).
- You are not actively trying to loot something else.
- You are not actively trading with another player.
- You are not actively crafting.
- The container is not locked.
- The container did not drop off a "current" raid boss.
- The container is Bind on Pickup (BoP), and is not tradable.
- The container is tradable, but does not contain a BoP item.
- The container is tradable, but does not contain a unique item.
- You do not have a Merchant Window Open.
- You do not have the Auction House Window Open
- You do not have your Bank Window Open.
- You do not have your Guild Bank Window Open.
- You do not have your Mailbox Window Open.

🚫 **The "UseContainerItem" API call no longer works on clams. This likely has something to do with the "[Clam Weaving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3YO7jeoOWs)" hack.**

## History

👏 **I didn't create this add-on, I just updated it for TBC and Wrath.**

Looking around CurseForge, it looks like the bulk of the original code came from kAutoOpen.
